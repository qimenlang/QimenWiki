![Hand joints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-Docs/master/specification/sources/images/ext_hand_tracking_joint_convention.png)

The process of translating hand tracking into VR controller input consists of:

- Mapping one or more hand joint poses to the VR controller pose.
- Recognizing gestures (based on hand joints positions relative to each other) and convert them into button inputs.[基于所有关节的相对位置]

When the OpenXR toolkit translates the hand poses into controller poses, it must choose from one of the 26 hand joints pose and optionally  perform an additional translation and/or rotation for the resulting  controller grip pose or aim pose to be usable.



#### 固定手势

**Pinch (one-handed)**

Bringing the tip of the thumb and index together.

**Thumb press (one-handed)**

Using the thumb to “press” onto the index finger. The target is the  “intermediate” joint of the index finger (see hand joint poses above).

**Index bend (one-handed)**

Bending the index finger in a trigger-like motion.

**Finger gun (one-handed)**

Using the thumb to “press” into the middle finger. The target is the  “intermediate” joint of the middle finger (see hand joint poses above).  This gesture allows the index finger to be extended (pointing forward).

**Squeeze (one-handed)**

Bending the middle finger, ring finger and little finger in a trigger-like motion.

**Wrist tap (two-handed)**

Using the tip of the index finger from the opposite hand to press on the wrist.

**Palm tap (two-handed)**

Using the tip of the index finger from the opposite hand to press on the center of the palm.

**Index tip tap (two-handed)**

Bring the tip of both index fingers together.
