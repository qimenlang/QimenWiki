### 进程间通信（Inter Process Communication IPC）

1. 进程可以分为两种类型

   - 独立进程
   - 合作进程

   进程间通信是一个可以让进程相互进行通信，并且同步动作的机制；

2. 进程通信的两种方式

   - 共享内存
   - 发送消息

3. 共享内存

   - 无边界buffer
   - 有边界buffer，生产者消费者模式，二者生产消费都存在数量限制

4. 发送消息

   - 建立通信连接
     - 建立方式
     - 直接通信 **Direct Communication links** are implemented when the processes use a specific process identifier for the communication, but it is hard to identify the sender ahead of time. 
       **For example the print server.**
     - 间接通信**In-direct Communication** is done via a shared mailbox (port), which consists of a queue of messages. The sender keeps the message in mailbox and the receiver picks them up.
   - 进程相互收发消息
     - 消息可以是固定长度、可以是不固定长度
     - 消息由两个部分组成：header、body
       - The **header part** is used for storing message type, destination id, source id, message length, and control information. The control information contains information like what to do if runs out of buffer space, sequence number, priority. Generally, message is sent using FIFO style.

5. ##### Advantages of IPC:

   1. Enables processes to communicate with each other and share resources, leading to increased efficiency and flexibility.
   2. Facilitates coordination between multiple processes, leading to better overall system performance.
   3. Allows for the creation of distributed systems that can span multiple computers or networks.
   4. Can be used to implement various synchronization and communication protocols, such as semaphores, pipes, and sockets.

   ##### Disadvantages of IPC:

   1. Increases system complexity, making it harder to design, implement, and debug.
   2. Can introduce security vulnerabilities, as processes may be able to access or modify data belonging to other processes.
   3. Requires careful management of system resources, such as memory and CPU time, to ensure that IPC operations do not degrade overall system performance.
      Can lead to data inconsistencies if multiple processes try to access or modify the same data at the same time.
   4. Overall, the advantages of IPC outweigh the disadvantages, as it is a necessary mechanism for modern operating systems and enables processes to work together and share resources in a flexible and efficient manner. However, care must be taken to design and implement IPC systems carefully, in order to avoid potential security vulnerabilities and performance issues.
